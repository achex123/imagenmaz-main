# Gemini AI Image Editor

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project
2. Add your Gemini API key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Restart the development server

Note: The application will still work in demo mode without an API key, but for real API integration, you'll need to obtain a valid Gemini API key.
